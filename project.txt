You have to identify and outline a small, well-scoped security problem, and propose
a holistic solution. Independent tools or techniques (like encryption or authentication)
alone do not ensure security; the goal is to demonstrate how multiple mechanisms and design
choices interact to create a secure system

“Designing a Multi-Layered Anti-Phishing System to Mitigate Malicious Emails and Links”

1. Problem Statement
Phishing attacks through unwanted emails and malicious links remain one of the most prevalent causes of data breaches and identity theft. Attackers use deceptive emails, spoofed domains, and fake websites to trick users into revealing sensitive credentials or installing malware. Traditional spam filters can block bulk spam but often fail to detect sophisticated, targeted phishing attempts that mimic trusted senders.
 The core problem addressed in this project is how to design an end-to-end, layered defense system that detects and prevents phishing attempts while maintaining usability and user trust.

2. Threat Model
Adversaries:
 Cybercriminals who send fraudulent emails containing malicious links or attachments. They may impersonate legitimate organizations (banks, universities, service providers) or use compromised accounts to spread attacks.
Attack Vectors:
Spoofed sender addresses that appear authentic.


Embedded links that redirect to phishing sites.


Attachments containing malware or scripts.


Social engineering messages urging immediate action (“verify your account,” “update password”).


Assets at Risk:
 User credentials, personal data, financial information, and organizational systems accessible through compromised accounts.
